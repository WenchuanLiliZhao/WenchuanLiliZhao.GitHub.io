      <p>The host is riding from Knocknarea,</p>
      <p>And over the grave of Clooth-na-bare;</p>
      <p>Caolte tossing his burning hair,</p>
      <p>And Niamh calling, "Away, come away;</p>
      <p>Empty your heart of its mortal dream.</p>
      <p>The winds awaken, the leaves whirl round,</p>
      <p>Our cheeks are pale, our hair is unbound,</p>
      <p>Our breasts are heaving, our eyes are a-gleam,</p>
      <p>Our arms are waving, our lips are apart,</p>
      <p>And if any gaze on our rushing band,</p>
      <p>We come between him and the deed of his hand,</p>
      <p>We come between him and the hope of his heart."</p>
      <p>The host is rushing 'twixt night and day;</p>
      <p>And where is there hope or deed as fair?</p>
      <p>Caolte tossing his burning hair,</p>
      <p>And Niamh calling, "Away, come away."</p>
